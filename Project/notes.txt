Notes:
- Use Crowdsourcing to train a neural network
	- create a pool of words in such a way i then can extract for testing the pronunciation.

- The difference between the pronunciation of the user and the (average?) crowd will yield the score
- The rest will be the same
- The writing of Introduction, Background, Future Works must start from day 1
- Every Friday I have to send an email to Olle to keep him updated

- Send an email to Olle with the day I will start the project




IDEAS:
- Find a way to teach stressed words using graphs or images
- Game-based competition for improving the pronunciation of stressed words
