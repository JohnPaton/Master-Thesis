Notes:
- Use Crowdsourcing to train a neural network
	- create a pool of words in such a way i then can extract for testing the pronunciation.

- The difference between the pronunciation of the user and the (average?) crowd will yield the score
- The rest will be the same
- The writing of Introduction, Background, Future Works must start from day 1
- Every Friday I have to send an email to Olle to keep him updated

- Send an email to Olle with the day I will start the project




IDEAS:
- Find a way to teach stressed words using graphs or images
- Game-based competition for improving the pronunciation of stressed words


- Based on the position, we create a way to formulate sentences that could be useful in that situation. Example:
1) GPS says you are in a bar or nearby it
2) The application gives some sentences based on the place. If it a bar: “I’d like a coffee”, “Where is the restroom?”, etc. in the Target Language!
3) The user pronounce it and the system will compared it in the ANN trained by the crowd
|
 —> The same type of idea can be done as game-competition, where the player has 30 seconds (or more) to formulate sentences in the Target Language
