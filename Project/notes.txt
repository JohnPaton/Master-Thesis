Notes:
- Use Crowdsourcing to train a neural network
	- create a pool of words in such a way i then can extract for testing the pronunciation.

- The rest will be the same
- The writing of Introduction, Background, Future Works must start from day 1
- Every Friday I have to send an email to Olle to keep him updated

- Send an email to Olle with the day I will start the project

IDEAS:

HCI Part:
- English Language (Intermediate/Advance level of english)
- Accents/stress words  —> VISUAL PART in the application to help the user to understand how to pronounce the word (need to find out some references about it)
- Slang/Idioms -> collected from Native Speakers (social medias)
  -> Twitter/Facebook/Instagram/Pinterest/Foursquare -> comments
- Context/Map -> what people say around you (or your friends in general)

ML part:
- ANN trained with the crowd
- Design a system to be able to compare the user’s pronunciation with the Native Speaker/s one/s

OTHER:
- Picture aspect




Notes:
*** Distinction between “day-by-day Slang” and “Social Media Slang”***
1) ex: I’m pulling your legs
2) ex: #YOLO #LOL etc.
