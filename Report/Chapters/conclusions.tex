In conclusion, we can claim that the application has a lot of potential and there is lot of room for improvements. Looking at the results, we understood that users did not much improve the pronunciation with the tools we provided. After a careful analysis of the data, we think that users did not use the application enough for seeing an actual improvement. There could be multiple reasons for that: few sentences available, few indications on improving the pronunciation, long waiting time in order to get a feedback, etc. \\
\noindent We also think that users did not understand why we insert features such as the \textit{critical listening} and the \textit{history page}. A reason could be that, despite linguistic research claims that these two features are very useful during the learning process, for pronunciation purpose, users need something else. Finding out the actual needs, goes out the scope of our research. For sure, we understood that these two methods are not particularly important for this process. \\
\noindent The results related to the feedback page were not particularly high. We think that, a more careful study on how to deliver the feedback to user, is necessary in the future, or rather, finding a way to give clearer directions on how to improve the pronunciation. Although, the scope of the project was to avoid the usage of words in order to give feedback, but simply using visual information. We find out that this type of information is very hard to deliver and in the future, a better/different approach is definitely necessary. \\

\noindent Despite some low scores, our testers appreciated the prototype and the way we delivered the idea. People need this kind of applications to learn and improve languages because the interested regarding the usage of mobile devices and become well-versed in other lingos, is very high.
