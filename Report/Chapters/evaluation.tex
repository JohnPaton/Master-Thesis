\chapter{User studies and Results}
\label{chap:results}

The results of this study were determined by the answers of a survey completed by the users that participate to the testing phase. \\
\noindent We recruited 6 people from Uppsala University and asked them to use the application for a period of 2 weeks and fill up a survey with 26 questions (see Appendix). The survey is anonymous and divided in 3 sections: the first part was designed to gather the information related to the audience. The second part aimed to rate the interest in learning a new language using a mobile device, whereas the third part was dedicated to the application itself. \\

\subsection*{Audience}
\label{sub:Audience}

This section presents the answers related to the users personal information to get a better understaning of the audience. From \ref{fig:gender_chart} and \ref{fig:age_chart} we can say that the majority of our users are male and between the age of 24-29 years old.  Table \ref{table:native_languages} describes the native language of the users.

\noindent All testers were students from the Computer Science department as well as comfortable in using mobile applications on a daily base.

\subsection*{Interest}
\label{sub:Interest}

This section describes the interest of our testers in learning and improving a new language using a mobile application instead of the traditional student-teacher class. Results are vey positive and we can confirm that the interest is high. In particular, avoiding the interaction with a physical teacher is very welcomed.
