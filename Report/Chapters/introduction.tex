\chapter{Introduction}
The pronunciation is one of the hardest part of learning a language among all the other componests, such as grammar rules and vocabulary. To achive a good level of pronunciation, non native speakers have to study and costantly practise the target language for a incredible amount of hours. In most cases, when students are learning a new language, the teacher is not a native speaker in which imply that the pronunciation may be influenced by the country where he or she comes from. The reason is a normal consequence of second learning language \cite{derwing2005second}. In fact, \cite{medgyes2001teacher} states that the advantages of having a Native speaker as a teacher lie in the superior liguistic compentences especially the usage of the language more spontaniously in different communication situations. Pronunciation falls into those competences underlying a base problem in teaching pronunciation at school.  \\

\noindent The basic questions we tried to answer in this work is: why is pronunciation so important? What are the most effective methods for improving the pronunciation? What the research state-of-art and what can we do to make it better? \\

\noindent The first question is fairly easy to answer. There are two reasons to claim why pronunciation is important: \textit{(i)} it helps to acquire the target language faster and \textit{(ii)} being understood.
Regarding the first point, earlier a learner masters the basics of pronunciation, the faster it will become fluent. The reason is that \textit{critical listening} with a particular focus on hearing the sounds will lead to gain fluency in speaking the language.
The second point is \textbf{crucial} when working with other people, especially in these days where both in school and business the environment is often multicultural. Pronunciation mistakes may lead the person to being misunderstood affecting the results of a project for example. \\

\noindent With these statements in mind, \cite{gilakjani2011pronunciation} gives suggestions on how a lerner can effectively improve the pronunciation. Four important ways are explained in this research: \textit{Conversation} is the most relevant approach to improve pronuniation, although, a supervision of an \textit{expert guidance} that corrects the mistakes is foundamental during the process of learning. At the same time, learnes have to be pro-active to have conversation with other native speakers in such a way to costantly practising. \textit{Repetitions} of pronunciation exercises is another important factor that will help the learner to be better in speaking. As last, \textit{Critical listening}, that we also mentioned above, amplify the opportunity of learning the way native speakers pronounce words. In particular, for a learner is important to understand the difference when he or she is pronouncing a certain sentece with the one said by the native speaker. This method is very effective and is important for understanding the different sounds of the language and how a native speaker is able to reproduce them \cite{rost2014listening}.

\noindent An important factor while learning a second language is to have a feedback about improvements. Teachers are usually responsible to judge the way the learners' progress. In fact, when teaching pronunciation, often it is used a draw the intonation and the stress of the words in such a way that the learner is able to see how the utterances should be pronounced. The \textit{British Council} shows this practice \cite{bbc_stress}. The usage of visual feedbacks is the key of learning pronunciation and it is the main feature of this research. \\

\noindent In the computer science field, some works have been previously done regarding pronunciation. For instance, \cite{edge2012tip} helps lerners to acquire the tonal sound system of Mandarin Chinese through a mobile game. Another example is \cite{head2014tonewars} in which the application provides a platform where learners of Chinese language can interact with native speakers and challenging them to a competition of pronunciations of chinese tones.
\noindent The idea behind this project is based on the fact that people need to keep practising their pronunciation to improve as well as they need immediate feedbacks
